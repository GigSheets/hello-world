# hello-world
This is the first test of Github that I have done.

### until now I have only ever used Source Safe
I guess the reason is that I have never contributed to an open source project, purely because I never felt qualified to do so.

`this is a block of code
I am not sure if multiline works or if
I have to keep everything in one line. It looks like it gets converted to one line anyway.`

`Try multiline`
`Does this work`
`No it just creates small sisde by side blocks`

```
{
  "firstName": "John",
  "lastName": "Smith",
  "age": 25
}
```


```
I was supposed to create a fenced code block
That way I can have multiple linse of code
displaying one underneath the other.
```
